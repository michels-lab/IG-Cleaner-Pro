# Copilot instructions — IG Cleaner Pro

Read `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_LOG.md` and the relevant infrastructure/handoff documentation before editing.

Preserve the canonical Desktop engine and established cleanup workflows. Mobile-specific UX is allowed, but required feature parity must not be removed.

Keep raw Instagram exports local. Supabase is for authenticated workflow metadata/state unless a reviewed architecture change explicitly says otherwise. Never commit privileged keys or user export data.

Use current-commit validation for import, state migration, Focus/review/audit behavior, Android builds and sync changes. Device/provider claims remain unvalidated until actually exercised.

Update `PROJECT_LOG.md` for meaningful work. Do not publish a release unless explicitly assigned.

Product identity / About are fundamental product contracts. Treat the approved stacked-layers + sparkle geometry as the visual foundation across IG Cleaner Pro, not as a sticker. About must lead with IG Cleaner Pro identity/version, then About the author with the canonical Michel Duarte portrait, then the official Michel's Lab parent-brand mark, then social links rendered as **network icon + visible network name** using canonical profile URLs.



For logo/About/branding work, follow the Michel-Software-Standards Product Identity Standard and BRAND_ADOPTION_PLAYBOOK. Replace actual platform identity references, adapt the official geometry to this app's existing visual language, avoid sticker-style logo placement, preserve unrelated behavior, validate the build, and do not release without explicit authorization.

## Release/version authority

Read `release/distribution-manifest.json` before version/release work. Its `releasePolicy.nextRelease` is the authoritative next target. For the current candidate that target is **v120.34**. Never backslide to historical tags/workflows, never let generic validation publish a release, and never publish a prerelease when a normal release was requested. Publication still requires explicit user authorization.

## Structured handoff requirement

For any tracked Michel's Lab task, return enough machine-readable continuation context for the master handoff registry:

- task ID and repository;
- owner/role and branch;
- outcome;
- commits and areas changed;
- validations that **actually ran** and their real result;
- evidence status: `verified`, `inferred`, or `blocked`;
- remaining work;
- blockers/manual evidence still required;
- suggested next owner/role when useful.

Do not list planned tests/builds/device checks as completed validation. If required validation was not performed, the task must be released/handed back with that work pending rather than described as complete.

# Michel's Lab shared child-agent contract

This managed block is cross-project policy. Repository-specific instructions may add stricter local rules outside this block, but they must not weaken or contradict it.

## Shared authority

- Michel's Lab shared standards, product identity, governance, release and coordination rules are authoritative in `realmichelduarte/Michel-Software-Standards`.
- Keep product implementation truth and product-specific audit logs in this child repository.
- Do not silently invent a conflicting local Michel's Lab rule.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, signing material, private tokens or passwords.
- Historical green CI is not proof for the current commit.

## Product identity / About

- Preserve the approved product-logo geometry; contextual color, material, lighting and motion may adapt without identity drift.
- Branding is a design language, not sticker placement.
- About hierarchy is **Product identity → About the author → Michel's Lab → social profiles**.
- Use the current canonical Michel Duarte portrait and the official Michel's Lab parent-brand assets from the master authority when implementing/updating About.
- The canonical portrait file is immutable: child repositories must vendor it byte-for-byte. Never resize, crop, recompress, retouch, regenerate, convert or rewrite the portrait asset itself; use render-time layout/object-fit/masking only.
- Visible social controls use recognizable network icon **and** visible network name with canonical profile URLs.

## Canonical identity asset precedence

- Product-logo authority is `shared-assets/product-logos/manifest.json` in the master standards repository.
- Michel's Lab parent-brand authority is `shared-assets/michels-lab/manifest.json`.
- Assets explicitly marked legacy/rejected must never supersede the current canonical geometry.
- When `.michelslab/identity-sync.json` marks an identity section `enforced`, child canonical copies must match the master source exactly; hash drift is a governance defect.
- When identity state is `migration_pending`, do not auto-replace local assets. Stop, reconcile the active surfaces explicitly and preserve the approved master geometry.
- A local filename such as `official-*.svg` is not proof of authority by itself; authority comes from the current master manifest and identity-sync policy.

## Cross-chat coordination

- Tracked work follows the master claim lifecycle: `unclaimed → claim → heartbeat → complete/release → structured handoff`.
- If a different owner holds an active non-stale claim, stop instead of duplicating edits.
- A stale claim requires a freshness check before resuming/reclaiming work.
- A claim is coordination state only; it is never validation or release permission.
- Return branch/commit/evidence information so the master claim can be heartbeated, completed or released correctly.

## Structured handoff

For tracked work, return:
- task ID and repository;
- owner/role and branch;
- outcome;
- commits and areas changed;
- validations that **actually ran** and their real result;
- evidence status: `verified`, `inferred`, or `blocked`;
- remaining work;
- blockers/manual evidence still required;
- suggested next owner/role when useful.

Never list a planned build/test/device/store check as completed validation. If required validation was not performed, hand the task back with that work pending instead of claiming completion.

## Release and evidence boundary

- Do not publish/release unless explicitly authorized.
- Manual/device/store/provider validation remains pending until actually performed.
- Do not fabricate screenshots, device behavior, store status, cloud/provider state or test results.
- Preserve unrelated known-good behavior and keep changes bounded to the assigned task.
- For installable Windows apps, the canonical direct release is built by GitHub Actions from the authorized commit/tag and delivers a real Setup installer as the normal-user artifact.
- Use `<Product>-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` for the recommended installer. If a portable build is also shipped, name it explicitly `<Product>-Portable-vX.Y.Z.exe`; never leave the portable filename ambiguous when both exist.
- Smoke-test the generated Windows installer by actually installing/verifying/uninstalling in CI where practical; compiling the installer alone is insufficient evidence.
- Publish SHA-256 for direct Windows binaries. Authenticode/code signing, when available, must happen before final checksum publication. Without a publisher certificate, do not hide or misrepresent Windows Unknown publisher/SmartScreen behavior.
- FoamLens and Michel's Life are the current Windows release references; Michel's Life also demonstrates optional Authenticode and a separate Microsoft Store MSIX path.
