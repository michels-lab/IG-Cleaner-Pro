# IG Cleaner Pro — Project Log & Functional Contract

_Last updated: 2026-09-29_

This file is the **functional contract** for IG Cleaner Pro. UI redesigns, refactors, performance work, and future releases must preserve the capabilities listed here unless Michel Armando Duarte Flores explicitly requests their removal.

## Stable reference

- **Stable functional baseline:** v119 — HTML comparable-range · JSON intact.
- Experimental v120.x redesign previews are **not** allowed to redefine or silently remove v119 functionality.
- Before merging a redesign into `main`, compare the new build against this contract and the v119 baseline.

---

## Non-negotiable architecture

### Review = Following only

Review is exclusively for accounts **Michel follows**.

It must preserve:
- Following cleanup workflow.
- Foco 20 / 30 / 40.
- Recommended batches.
- Recheck / second-review workflow.
- Double Check workflow.
- Protected / reviewed / snoozed states.
- Current-session counters and active-batch tracking.
- Saved history/activity.
- Filters and direct views for accounts that do not follow back.

**Do not reintroduce a "Clean followers" mode inside Review.** Followers has its own dedicated workspace.

### Followers = people who follow the account

Followers must preserve its own dedicated workspace and must not be reduced to a passive table.

It must include:
- Its **own focus controls**.
- Its **own batch/session bar**, equivalent in usefulness to Review.
- Saved history/activity visible inside Followers.
- Search, filters, relation status, risk, review state, protection, and profile actions.
- A Mutuals subview for followers Michel also follows.

### Mutuals

Mutuals is a sub-workflow inside Followers.

It must preserve:
- Foco 20 / 30 / 40.
- Recommended batch.
- Risk batch.
- Review state and protection.
- Its own session/progress tracking.
- Relationship context and review history.

### Pending

Pending is exclusively for pending follow requests.

It must preserve:
- Pending-specific focus/recommended/risk workflows.
- Pending session tracking.
- Pending review/decision state.
- Cross-check logic against Following/Followers.
- No Review or Followers focus may appear here by accident.

---

## Review — mandatory second-review system

The following controls and their behavior are **mandatory** and must not disappear during UI redesign:

### Revisar de nuevo 30
- Reopens accounts that **currently do not follow back**, even if they were already reviewed.
- Must allow already-reviewed rows to be checked again.
- Must show a confirmation popup after opening.
- Must update the review state when confirmed.
- Uses its own cycle/history state so the workflow can rotate through candidates.

### Double Check 30
- Opens accounts that **currently do not follow back**.
- Rotates through different profiles instead of repeatedly serving the same first 30.
- Maintains a separate seen/cycle state.
- Must show a confirmation popup.
- When all current candidates have passed through the cycle, the user can reset/restart the cycle.

### Ver NO ME SIGUE revisados
- Must remain available.
- Shows accounts that currently do not follow back **including already-reviewed accounts**.
- This view exists specifically so previously reviewed relationships can be validated again.

### Cycle controls
Keep visible controls for:
- Reset Double Check cycle.
- Reset Recheck / Revisar de nuevo cycle.

Do not replace these with a generic focus button.

---

## Focus behavior — mandatory

All Focus-style flows must:
- Open Instagram profiles in tabs.
- Leave a confirmation/review UI open in IG Cleaner.
- Preserve active-batch state until the user resolves or cancels it.
- Avoid mixing candidates from another module.
- Never let a global focus control silently switch between Review, Followers, Mutuals, or Pending.

### Context under each username

Where Focus/Recheck/Double Check shows a username, show useful relationship context directly below it when data is available, for example:

- `Lo sigues desde 2022`
- `Te sigue desde 2021`
- `No te sigue`
- `Revisado hace 18 días`
- `Nunca revisado`
- `Te dejó de seguir`

This is context for the user, not a hidden scoring explanation.

---

## Batch/session tracking — mandatory

Review, Followers, Mutuals, and Pending must retain useful batch/session feedback where applicable, including:
- Batches today.
- Reviewed today.
- Reopened/rechecked.
- Active batch.
- Available/openable candidates.
- Last action.
- Ability to recover/reopen/cancel an active batch when supported.

A one-line "Last action" message **does not replace** the batch/session system.

---

## Saved history/activity — mandatory

The app must preserve the automatic review/activity history.

Followers must have a visible saved-history/activity area comparable to Review, scoped to the relevant Followers/Mutuals workflow.

Do not replace the history table/list with only a "last action" label.

History should preserve useful events such as:
- opened
- reopened
- reviewed
- unconfirmed
- snoozed
- last section
- last decision
- last opened
- last reviewed

Export of automatic history must remain available when supported by the stable baseline.

---

## Relationship evidence rules

- Do not treat missing accounts in a partial HTML export as confirmed non-followers.
- JSON behavior from the stable baseline must not be changed casually.
- Relationship conclusions must respect the comparable-range / evidence safeguards already implemented.
- UI redesigns must never weaken evidence correctness.

---

## UX rules

- Primary visual direction is **dark**, not light.
- Avoid generic admin-dashboard styling.
- Redesigns may change layout and visual hierarchy, but **must not remove functionality**.
- Do not duplicate the same workflow in multiple modules.
- Each module owns its actions:
  - Review → Following
  - Followers → Followers
  - Mutuals → mutual followers
  - Pending → pending requests
- Do not add context-dependent global buttons that can trigger the wrong module.
- Keep Focus and review actions obvious and local to their section.

---

## 2026-09-29 — redesign lesson

During the v120.x UI experiments, several regressions were found:
- Followers controls were replaced with generic Focus buttons.
- Followers lost its batch/session presentation.
- Followers lost visible saved history.
- The second-review / Recheck / Double Check controls disappeared from the redesigned Review UI.
- A global/contextual Focus control could show actions from the wrong module.

These are now explicitly documented as **regressions that must not recur**.

The redesign may continue, but functionality must be preserved first and reorganized second.


## 2026-09-29 — mandatory module sidebars

The right-side **live sidebar is part of the functional UX contract**, not an optional decoration.

- **Review** keeps its existing right-side live panel.
- **Followers** must have its own right-side live panel with Followers/Mutuals-specific data.
- **Pending** must have its own right-side live panel with Pending-specific data.
- These sidebars should contain the module's live/session information such as last action, opened/reviewed counts, pending/resolved state, active batch, reopen counts, module-specific status, saved history/activity, and relevant quick actions.
- When Followers switches between **All Followers** and **Mutuals**, the same Followers sidebar may update its scope, but it must remain visible.
- Do **not** replace these sidebars with session/history cards inserted into the central workspace.
- The central workspace is for the module's focus controls, filters, tables and primary content; live tracking belongs in the right sidebar.
- A redesign that removes either the Followers or Pending sidebar is a regression.


### Recent activity parity across module sidebars

Review, Followers/Mutuals, and Pending must each expose a full **Recent activity** block in their right-side live sidebar.

At minimum, each module must show its own scoped metrics for:
- reviewed in the last 1 h and 3 h;
- opened in the last 1 h and 3 h;
- Focus activity in the last 1 h and 3 h;
- action count in the last 1 h and 3 h;
- reviewed today and in the last 24 h;
- opened today and in the last 24 h;
- batches today and in the last 24 h;
- protected/paused today as appropriate to the module;
- reopened today.

These counters must be **module-scoped**. Followers/Mutuals must not show Review or Pending activity, and Pending must not show Review or Followers activity.

A reduced sidebar that only shows last action + a few totals is a regression.


### Standard activity hierarchy for all three work sidebars

The right-side live panels for **Review**, **Followers/Mutuals**, and **Pending** must use the same primary activity hierarchy.

Required order, from top to bottom:
1. **Last action** — show exactly what was done and when it happened.
2. **Opened this session**.
3. **Opened today**.
4. **Opened in the last 7 rolling days**.
5. **Opened in the last 1 hour**.
6. **Opened in the last 2 hours**.
7. **Opened in the last 3 hours**.
8. **Module-scoped action history**.
9. Secondary module-specific state and controls.

“Opened” means profiles actually opened through logged open/focus/reopen actions; the same definition must be used across all three modules.

Followers may switch scope to Mutuals, but the hierarchy stays identical and only the data scope changes.

Do not replace this structure with different metric sets for each module.

### JSON detection diagnostic rule

The file-detection preview must never label a valid JSON file as invalid because only a truncated header was parsed.

- Full JSON must be read before using JSON.parse for validity.
- Header-only sampling may be used for HTML detection.
- “JSON inválido” is reserved for a full JSON document that actually fails parsing.
- Diagnostic/preview messaging must agree with the importer whenever the importer successfully parses the file.


### Explicit relative time for last action

The top card of the Review, Followers/Mutuals, and Pending sidebars must state the last action in explicit human relative time.

Required pattern:
- `ÚLTIMA ACCIÓN · hace 3 horas`
- `ÚLTIMA ACCIÓN · hace 5 días`
- `ÚLTIMA ACCIÓN · hace 12 minutos`
- `ÚLTIMA ACCIÓN · hace un momento`

Directly below it, show what was done. The exact date/time may remain as secondary text.

Do not show only an absolute timestamp or force the user to calculate how long ago the action happened.


#### Relative-time precision

The last-action relative timestamp must be precise enough to identify when the event happened, while still showing the exact date/time underneath.

Examples:
- `hace 7 min`
- `hace 1 h 23 min`
- `hace 5 h 04 min`
- `hace 2 días 3 h`
- `hace 1 semana 2 días`
- `hace 2 meses 5 días`
- `hace 1 año 2 meses`

For events under 24 hours, preserve minutes rather than rounding down to only whole hours.


## 2026-09-29 — Mutuals and non-followed Followers are separate workspaces

The Followers data must be partitioned into two distinct workspaces in the UI:

### Mutuals
Contains only followers that the user also follows (`iFollow === true`).

It must have its own:
- page/navigation entry;
- Focus 20 / 30 / 40;
- recommended/risk batches;
- filters and table;
- standardized right sidebar;
- last action, opened-session/time-window metrics and action history.

### Followers que no sigo
Contains only followers that follow the user but the user does not follow (`iFollow === false`).

It must have its own:
- page/navigation entry;
- Focus 20 / 30 / 40;
- recommended/risk batches;
- filters and table;
- standardized right sidebar;
- last action, opened-session/time-window metrics and action history.

Do **not** put Mutuals and followers the user does not follow in the same page behind an internal `Todos / Mutuos / No los sigo` selector.

Historical data may come from the same Followers export, but presentation, focus candidates, action history and live session scope must stay separated.

### Layout rule
Mutuals, Followers que no sigo and Pending use exactly one flexible central content column plus one right live sidebar on desktop. Never reserve sidebar width twice through nested padding/fixed-panel rules; doing so crushes the central content and is a regression.


## 2026-09-30 — Complete Instagram ZIP is the primary import workflow

The **primary** way to load Instagram data into IG Cleaner Pro is the complete `.zip` export downloaded from Instagram.

Required behavior:
- The Import page must present **Import complete Instagram export (.zip)** as the recommended/default path.
- The user should not need to unzip the export manually.
- ZIP processing happens locally in the browser; the archive is not uploaded to a server.
- Search recursively through folders inside the archive.
- Automatically identify and group every supported export, including:
  - Following;
  - all `followers_*` files;
  - Pending follow requests;
  - Recent follow requests;
  - Recently unfollowed profiles;
  - Blocked profiles;
  - other export categories explicitly supported by the app in the future.
- Following/Followers/Pending found in the ZIP must be loaded into their normal app workflows automatically.
- Additional supported exports must be analyzed and surfaced automatically rather than requiring the user to select them again.
- The ZIP route must reuse the **same format detection/parsers** as manual import. Do not maintain a second independent interpretation of Instagram data.
- Files may be nested in arbitrary folders; do not depend on one fixed Instagram folder path.
- Multiple Followers files must be combined automatically.
- Manual upload of individual JSON/HTML files remains available as an **advanced/alternative import path**, not the primary UX.
- Invalid/encrypted/unsupported archives must produce an explicit error without destroying the currently stored review state.


### ZIP fixture must be derived from a real export structure

The repository fixture at `tests/fixtures/instagram-export-sample.zip` must remain sanitized but structurally faithful to a real Instagram export.

For the 2026-09-30 reference structure:
- preserve the 13 real archive paths and nested folders;
- preserve JSON root types and key shapes;
- preserve the three `followers_*.json` split;
- preserve the real Pending / Recent / Blocked `label_values` schema;
- preserve ZIP STORE (method 0) when that is what the real export uses;
- include neighboring exports such as `following_hashtags.json` so regression tests prove they are ignored rather than misclassified.

The importer must be tested against both the sanitized fixture and the locally supplied real reference ZIP before a ZIP-import change is considered validated.

A real regression found during this validation: `following_hashtags.json` was initially misclassified as Following because of the filename substring. The ZIP classifier must only treat the actual Following account export as Following.

Validated reference counts on 2026-09-30: **11,785 Following / 21,824 Followers / 418 Pending**.


### ZIP-to-Pending synchronization is mandatory

When `pending_follow_requests` is found inside the primary Instagram ZIP import:

- parsed rows must be assigned to `pendingRequestsRaw`, persisted, and rendered immediately in the Pending workspace;
- the Pending workspace must visibly state that its current source came from the ZIP and show the number of loaded requests;
- the manual Pending file input is an alternative/replacement path only; it must not keep presenting `Sin archivo` as if no Pending source exists after successful ZIP import;
- ZIP import must reset stale Pending search/risk/age/view filters to a visible all-data state so imported records cannot appear missing because of an old filter;
- after global rebuild/filter routines run, Pending must be rendered again so later refreshes cannot leave a stale empty table;
- if Pending data exists but the current filters produce zero rows, the empty-state message must say that no rows match the filters rather than asking the user to upload `pending_follow_requests.json`.

The real 2026-09-30 reference ZIP contains exactly one `connections/followers_and_following/pending_follow_requests.json` file with **418** entries using the `label_values` schema.
